# DisableSounds

Disable various system sounds.

- Disable (regionally) forced camera sound
- Disable shutter sound
- Disable screenshot sound

## Forced camera sound

In some regions the camera sounds
for shutter, start/stop recording and focus
are enforced by law.
This module tells the system that disabling the sounds
is allowed.
The system and apps will then show/enable their options
for disabling camera/shutter sounds.
This hook is always enabled, since allowing the option to appear,
does not change the option by default.
Be aware that it might be illegal to disable camera sounds in your country.
