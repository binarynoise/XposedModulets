## KeepSplitScreenRatio

Keep the split screen ratio, when switching one of the split apps.

Only usable on Android 14 and later,
since previous versions did not force a split resize in this situation.

## KeepSwapRatio

Keep the split ratio while swapping sides.

## SnapMode

Change the snap mode used by the system:

* `16:9` snapping useful for playing videos in split screen
* `FIXED` snapping allows for custom ratios and [additional snap targets](#additionalsnaptargets)
* `1:1` only allows the middle 50:50 split

## FreeSnap

Allow any split ratio instead of snapping to predefined ratios.

## AdditionalSnapTargets

Add additional snapping targets to snap to.

## RemoveMinimalTaskSize

Remove the minimal task size limit to allow split screen with unreasonably small apps.
