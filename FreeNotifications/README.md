# Free Notifications

New Android versions introduced finer settings for notifications.
But they thought it was a good idea to exempt some Notification Channels from that customization, like the "Developer Options enabled"-Notification.
_Yeah, I know that. I did that. Now, please remove that notification._

This module enables customization for all Notification Channels again: vibrations, ringtones, importance etc.

When removing the module, the changed notification settings will stay as they were, only you won't be able to edit them anymore
(until you install the module again).
